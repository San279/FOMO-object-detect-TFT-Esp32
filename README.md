# FOMO-object-detect-TFT-Esp32
This project was intended for displaying camera feed and [FOMO object detection model](https://edge-impulse.gitbook.io/docs/edge-impulse-studio/learning-blocks/object-detection/fomo-object-detection-for-constrained-devices) by [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/) inference results to TFT screen. The Hardware that was used were provided by [Wireless Solution Asia](https://wirelesssolution.asia/). To run this project users must obtain a model from Edge Impulse. <br/>
<strong>Please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/San279/Esp32-camera-to-tft) to set up TFT and Camera. </strong><br/> <br/>
## What you'll need
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), preferably the latest ones, but older versions will still do the job.
- ESP32-S3 is preferable but older version will do just fine.
- ST7789 or any TFT screens.
- OV2640 camera or any OV series.
