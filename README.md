# FOMO-object-detect-TFT-Esp32
This project was intended for displaying camera feed and inference results of [FOMO object detection model](https://edge-impulse.gitbook.io/docs/edge-impulse-studio/learning-blocks/object-detection/fomo-object-detection-for-constrained-devices) by [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/) to TFT screen. The Hardware were provided by [Wireless Solution Asia](https://wirelesssolution.asia/). To run this project users must obtain a model from Edge Impulse. 
<br/> <br/>
<strong> - I've created repository to provide simple guide to traning your model please visit [train-FOMO-object-detect-esp32](https://github.com/San279/train-FOMO-object-detect-esp32). </strong> 
<br/>
<strong>- Please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/San279/Esp32-camera-to-tft) to set up TFT and Camera before running this project. </strong>

## What you'll need
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), preferably the latest ones, but older versions will still do the job.
- ESP32-S3 is preferable but older version will do just fine.
- ST7789 or any TFT screens.
- OV2640 camera or any OV series.
## Project files descriptions
- FOMO_object_detect_TFT.ino - Containes Arduino codes displaying camera feed and FOMO results to TFT screens.
## How to install and run the project
<strong> 1. Download the zip file and extract it to Arduino directory. </strong>
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/><b />
<strong> 2. Open Fomo_object_detect_TFT.ino, under tools change your Board to "ESP32S3 Dev Module" and PSRAM to "OPI PSRAM". </strong>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
 4. Connect pin no.1 of the Esp32 to a push button.
- if you're using [AIOT board](https://wirelesssolution.asia/), simply connect I/O port 1 to any push button.

<br/><br/>
- if you do not have AIOT board, connect I/O pin 1 of the Esp32 to one of the leg of a push button and other leg to 3v.
